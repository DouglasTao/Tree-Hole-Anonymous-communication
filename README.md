# Tree Hole Messaging Application

## Introduction
The Tree Hole Messaging Application is a web-based platform that allows users to create private spaces ("Tree Holes") where they can receive anonymous messages. Inspired by the concept of a "tree hole" where secrets can be whispered, this application offers a safe and confidential way for users to communicate and express themselves anonymously.

## Features
- **User Registration and Authentication**: Secure user sign-up and login functionality.
- **Personal Tree Hole Creation**: Each user can create their own "Tree Hole" identified by a unique ID or link.
- **Anonymous Messaging**: Users can send and receive messages anonymously.
- **Message Viewing**: Users can view messages sent to their "Tree Hole".
- **Security**: Implementation of standard security practices including encrypted passwords and JWT token-based authentication.

## Technologies Used
- **Front-end**: [Add technologies if front-end is developed]
- **Back-end**: Flask (Python), SQLAlchemy, JWT for authentication, bcrypt for password hashing.
- **Database**: SQLite for local development/testing, adaptable to other SQL-based databases.

## Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
   - Ensure Python is installed.
   - Install required Python packages:
     ```
     pip install Flask SQLAlchemy bcrypt pyjwt
     ```
3. **Initialize the Database**
   - Run the following commands in Python shell:
     ```python
     from app import db
     db.create_all()
     ```

## Running the Application
Execute the application by running:
```
python app.py
```
The application will start on `localhost` at a defined port (default is usually 5000).

## Usage
- **Register a New User**: Send a POST request to `/register` with a username and password.
- **Login**: Send a POST request to `/login` to receive an authentication token.
- **Send a Message**: Use the token to send a POST request to `/send_message`.
- **View Messages**: Use the token to send a GET request to `/get_messages` to view all received messages.
